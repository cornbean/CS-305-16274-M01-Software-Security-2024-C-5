•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
      o	Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops financial plans for its customers. They wanted to modernize its operations and wants to use more effective software security in its web-based software.
•	 What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
      o	It is important to code securely as it makes both you and the customer feel safe knowing that everyone’s data is secure. When the customer trusts you, they will use your product more and tell their friends and family about it. If you loose that trust, it is very hard or near impossible to win it back, meaning you’ve lost a customer from doing business. Plus it can also have legal ramifications if your software isn’t secure, such as being fined for data breaches. Holding a good reputation with your customers grows the business and lets everyone know you care about them and their data.

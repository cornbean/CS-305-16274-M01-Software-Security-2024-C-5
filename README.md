Q. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

A. Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops financial plans for its customers. They wanted to modernize its operations and wants to use more effective software security in its web-based software.


Q. What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

A. It is important to code securely as it makes both you and the customer feel safe knowing that everyone’s data is secure. When the customer trusts you, they will use your product more and tell their friends and family about it. If you loose that trust, it is very hard or near impossible to win it back, meaning you’ve lost a customer from doing business. Plus it can also have legal ramifications if your software isn’t secure, such as being fined for data breaches. Holding a good reputation with your customers grows the business and lets everyone know you care about them and their data.

Q. Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

A. The dependency check was both the challenging and helpful part of the vulnerability assessment. It took me a bit to finally get it to work, with my java install not working properly. But once I got it to work it was helpful in laying out all the dependencies that were vulnerable so we can see what needs to be fix to make the app more secure.

Q. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

A. The best way to increase layers of security was to run the dependency report and update all the outdated dependencies to their latest version. Doing so ensured a lot of the bugs in the older versions are fixed and won't be a security threat anymore. For the vulnerabilities that wouldn't get fixed with just updating them, using penetration testing can help as it can let you know exactly how the vulnerability is being exploited. Then you can plan how to best correct it.

Q. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

A. As I wrote the code, I would run tests at every step to make sure everything functioned the way it should. Once the coding was complete, I then ran another dependency check to see what new vulnerabilities there were.

Q. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

A. Utilizing the resources provided in each module was a great asset, such as the Secure Coding Guidelines for Java and the OWASP Secure Coding Reference Guide. These helped during the process of coding that made it easier to figure out how to run the dependency check. 

Q. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

A. I would show the Vulnerability Assessment Report as that shows I was able to interpret the clients' needs and review their code to see how it can be improved to provide them the solution they are wanting.
